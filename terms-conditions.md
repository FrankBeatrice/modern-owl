    Once the delivery has been made based on your specifications, we are no longer responsible for any damage or delay on part of other persons, circumstances, or for the security of its contents. If you think the contents have been tampered with, please let us know as soon as possible so we can find a more suitable arrangement for the next delivery.

    in order to avoid putting our delivery teams at risk. In such a case, we will
