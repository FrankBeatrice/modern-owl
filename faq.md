- question: How do refunds and returns work?
  answer: |-
    It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

      - All discounted items sales are final.
      - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
      - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
- question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
  answer: "[GDPR](https://media3.giphy.com/media/1FMaabePDEfgk/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d1fc3ed7656643632f4131f&rid=giphy.gif),
    am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data handling
    process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt)."
- question: Rapid-fire questions
  answer: 'Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
    designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a theme for
    Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of opening up the JAMstack
    to more developers. Plus, we trust these folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix).
    <br /><br /> Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
    small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a robot, though.
    <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City? <br /> A: Have you been
    here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s the meaning of life? <br /> A:
    We’re not quite sure. But building useful products with people we love feels meaningful
    enough.'
