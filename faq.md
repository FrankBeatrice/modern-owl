- question: How long does delivery take?
  answer: |-
    Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

      - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
      - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
      - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
- question: How do refunds and returns work?
  answer: "It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint _someone_.
    Again, tell it like it is:\n\n* All transactions are final and non-refundable
    but eligible for store credit if modified or canceled  before scheduled delivery
    .\n* We have a 72 hour cancellation policy. If you can't receive your scheduled
    delivery, please notify us at least 72 hours in advance of delivery and we will
    credit your account for the amount of the order.\n* If your purchase is damaged,
    or in any manner, email us at  \n  VelocityTrainingNutrition@gmail.com, and we’ll
    refund you + send you a new one ASAP!"

    am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data handling
